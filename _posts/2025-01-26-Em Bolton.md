I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. I work with Dr Adam Moore and Dr April Bailey on socio-political research surrounding morality and gender. 
My current research involves investigating the self-coined concept of 'The Political Ouroboros' - a phenomenon whereby environmental uncertainty and instability result in the election of dangerous individuals who further exacerbate such conditions. This research is largely based in the US, utilising agent-based modelling to determine the role of intergroup conflict on leader endorsement.
Additionally, I am interested in the role of gender in leadership endorsement and how oppressive methods, such as reproductive injustice, emerge and spread as a result of endorsement. This follows on from my previous research in Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and the role of objectification, in which I argue for the exclusive investigation of sub-types of IPV rather than an amalgamation.
I further take part in the First Responder Communication Stategy research with UKRI, as well as external research with the BIAS lab.
Any questions, please do feel free to reach out to me!
